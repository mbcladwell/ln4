A simple GNU Guile project template.

This is the first version of the web interface derived from the ../ln directory
Coding began February 2020

I am using artanis as the web server, with a Guile environment
I started on React as an interface in: ./syncd/prog/react/
Working primarily on the AddTrgLyt page
Note that I incorporated R for graphing purposes
Plan was to package in Docker

Note that the ln directory has since purged Clojure


Stopped on 5/17/2020 and will switch to trying MySQL again with Java interface.

I will copy ln to ln5 for further MySQL development
